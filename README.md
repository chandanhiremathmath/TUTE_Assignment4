# Read a File and Handle Errors in Python

This Python script reads a file named `sample.txt` and prints its contents line by line.  
It also handles errors gracefully in case the file does not exist.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Opens a text file named `sample.txt`
- Reads and prints each line with line numbers
- Handles `FileNotFoundError` using a `try-except` block
- Manually closes the file after reading
